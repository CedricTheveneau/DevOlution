## Purpose

Dev'Olution is a personal project I created to make it simple for people to see my progress as a developer.
Another goal of this project is to show how organized I am, and to keep learning as I'm making another website.

It'll be organized as a blog, I want it to look clean, simple. I also want it to be straightforward and easy to navigate.

There will be one main page, with a list of the latest articles I'll have written about the lessons I have completed. After clicking on the article, it'll just pop up without loading a new page. This pop-up will contain various things: my feeling about the lesson in itself, what I'd need to work on to be better with the technology I disovered, a few keypoints so I don't have to look for them everywhere; and a link to the lesson.
Those articles will look like cards with a simple look, a title saying what technology it is about and a catchphrase.
At the very top of the main body, you'll get a table of content ith checkmarks so you can quikly see which lessons from my list I've completeted.
On larger screens, you'll get a feed on the right of the screen to keep track of latest development news - it'll be available at the bottom of the page for smaller screens.
The header will contain a centered logo, and a search bar -hidden by a search button on smaller screens-.
The footer will contain contact links, a form to contact me directly from the website and the legal notice.

To make it simple: **it'll be a way to see what I've learned, what I plan on learning to get a better developer.**

## Technologies
